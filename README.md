## Project Overview

This project applies data mining techniques to improve business strategies in the hotel industry by analyzing booking and review data.

We worked with two datasets:
- **Hotel Booking Dataset** – Contains booking details such as customer type, booking dates, and lead time.
- **TripAdvisor Reviews Dataset** – Contains user reviews and ratings for hotels in India.

---

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in bookings and cancellations.
- Use clustering to identify customer segments and behavior.
- Apply association rule mining to detect frequently co-occurring booking features.
- Conduct sentiment analysis on reviews to extract customer opinions.

## Techniques Used

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly

### Clustering
- K-Means clustering
- Elbow Method and Silhouette Score for optimal `k`

### Association Rule Mining
- Apriori algorithm to discover frequent itemsets and rules

### Sentiment Analysis
- TextBlob and VADER for polarity and sentiment classification

## Key Insights

- Customer type, lead time, and prior cancellations are strong indicators of booking cancellations.
- Clustering revealed distinct customer profiles, such as business travelers and families.
- Association rules highlighted factors such as lack of parking being associated with low ratings.
- Sentiment analysis indicated customer sentiment around staff, cleanliness, and service.
